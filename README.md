# Lama Dev School Management Dashboard

This project was created to learn Next.js by following the Lama Dev YouTube channel tutorials. It simulates a school management dashboard system and helped me practice both basic and advanced Next.js concepts.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
